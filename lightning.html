                <h2>The Lightning Playstyle</h2>
                <p>Before getting started with lightning you should know this: if
                    you&apos;ve heard things about the spec being strong or
                    overpowered, these are relics from 6.0 when it was indeed quite
                    strong. Lightning was traditionally a jack-of-all-trades kind of
                    spec: decent damage, decent survivability, decent control of enemy
                    players, decent AOE potential, et cetera; but not the best in any
                    of these categories. However, with the release of 7.0 it faces a
                    glaring survivability problem, as well as doing comparatively
                    much worse damage than in previous patches, so we will have to
                    make sacrifices in all secondary areas to compensate for these
                    newfound weaknesses. If you want to feel like Emperor Palpatine
                    and steamroll people effortlessly, respec to
                    <a href="/madness.html">madness</a> immediately
                    and don&apos;t bother to continue reading&mdash;this spec does not
                    have what you are looking for. That said, if you prefer a more
                    tactical, conservative playstyle involving outplaying defensive
                    cooldowns, choosing your opportunity windows, and reducing your
                    damage taken by way of positioning, or you just enjoy the brutal
                    sounds of firing off a different kind of lightning bolt with every
                    GCD, this spec does still have something to offer, and I will show
                    you how to force it into viability.</p>

                <h2>Viable Lightning Builds</h2>
                <p>There are essentially only two ways to build lightning without
                    becoming worm food every time a marauder so much as looks at you,
                    which we&apos;ll take a look at in a second. Both will use the
                    same gear and legendary implants, though with different tacticals.</p>
                <div id="build-gear">
                    <h3>Stim</h3>
                    <p>Use Advanced Kyrprax Versatile Stim. Do not pass go, do not
                        collect two hundred dollars.</p>
                    <h3>Gear and Set Bonus</h3>
                    <p>The gearing strategy is actually quite simple. For legendaries,
                        you want <strong>Gathering Storm Package</strong> and
                        <strong>Unmatched Haste Package</strong>, in that order.
                        Without Gathering Storm, Unmatched Haste barely does anything
                        for you, so prioritize Gathering Storm.</p>
                    <p>For regular gear, you want the best item level gear you can get
                        at any point in time. I recommend using the <strong>1.3 GCD</strong>
                        alacrity build, which will require 6 alacrity pieces, one of
                        which is your Gathering Storm implant. Thus, in addition to
                        your legendaries, you will need to get <strong>5 alacrity</strong>
                        enhancements and <strong>4 critical</strong> enhancements.
                        The moddable gear vendor <strong>Hyde and Zeek</strong> is far
                        and away the easiest way to do this, it isn&apos;t worth
                        bothering with any other method.</p>
                    <div class="multiplex">
                        <div class="mux-frame">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Augments</h3>
                    <p>If you use the build I&apos;ve prescribed, all of your augments
                        should be crit augments. If you&apos;re freestyling,
                        you&apos;ll want to use augments to reach the proper stat
                        thresholds, that being 3209 alacrity (for 1.3 second GCD) or
                        560 alacrity (for 1.4 second GCD); the rest of your stats go
                        into crit. Do not use accuracy on a sorcerer in PvP, it is a
                        complete waste of stats.</p>

                <div id="build-burst">
                    <h2>The Burst Build</h2>
                    <p>The first is a tactical, burst-cannon build with a lot of roots
                        and control to attempt to minimize the uptime enemy players have
                        on you, as compared to you on them. With this build you will
                        essentially have to duel anyone that tabs onto you in order to
                        force them to disengage or die.</p>
                    <h3>Tactical Item</h3>
                    <p>You will be running the <strong>Eyrin&apos;s Haste</strong>
                        tactical, and using the instant Thundering Blast it provides
                        as a root, with a bit of burst damage baked in on top.</p>

                        for either of the other options in that tier if you have a use

                        (good AOE potential for example).</p>

                <div id="build-cleave">
                    <h2>The Cleave Build</h2>
                    <p>The second build is a very tanky, but support-reliant and
                        immobile setup with the potential to output devastating AOE
                        damage and destroy an entire team. While on 90% of occasions
                        I recommend playing the first build, if you find yourself with
                        a competent tank and healer, this build can output devastating
                        pressure. It was mostly used for group ranked, but it&apos;s
                        worth documenting here because it can be a premade-buster with
                        proper support. With this build you should be using
                        <span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span>
                        and

                        as soon as they are available, and using

                        to supplement your already high passive damage reduction when
                        major burst is on the way. You should also use
                        <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                        and

                        to create distance and take cover from enemy ranged fire, as
                        always, but you will have limited opportunities to do so with
                        this build.</p>
                    <h3>Tactical Item</h3>
                    <p>You will be running the <strong>Elemental Convection</strong>
                        tactical, which will reset the cooldown of

                        and

                        This will ensure you never delay the proc, always do maximum

                        quicker. If there are multiple consistent targets, you will

                        <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                        to all of them, as you will passively refresh it resulting in

                <h3>Abilities</h3>
                <p>Lightning has six rotational rotational attacks which you will use
                    frequently. These are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>,

                    <span class="sprite sprite-chain-lightning">Chain Lightning</span> or
                    <span class="sprite sprite-halted-offensive">Halted Offensive</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-shock">Shock</span>, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-lightning-bolt">Lightning Bolt</span>.
                </p>
                <p>There are also two non-rotational abilities that you may use for
                    niche purposes or with certain builds (such as the cleave build).
                    These are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-lightning">Force Lightning</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-volt-rush">Volt Rush</span>.</p>
                <h3>Pre-Rotation: Apply Affliction</h3>
                <p>Before attacking a target, ensure that it has your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                    applied to it. Turning on <em>&quot;Highlight Personal Debuffs&quot;</em>
                    in the UI editor is a very easy way to track this (it will glow
                    gold.) Your affliction will refresh, so you don&apos;t need to use
                    it in rotation, but attacking a target without it on is very very
                    bad. Affliction causes your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>
                    to autocrit, which accounts for a great deal of your burst damage.
                    Do not forget it!
                </p>
                <h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
                <p>The &quot;rotation&quot; for Lightning is just a priority system.

                <h3>Offensive Cooldowns</h3>
                <p>You have two offensive cooldowns on sorc, these are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-recklessness">Recklessness</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-polarity-shift">Polarity Shift</span>.</p>
                <p><span class="sprite sprite-recklessness">Recklessness</span>
                    will make your next two abilities crit, guaranteed,
                    but it won&apos;t increase their critical bonus damage like a
                    normal autocrit would. The exception to this rule, however, is
                    <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>.
                    Since Thundering Blast already autocrits on targets that have your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                    on them, Recklessness will just <strong>increase that damage by
                    60%</strong>. That is a large number, and it stacks with your other
                    offensive cooldowns. As a rule of thumb, you want to use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-recklessness">Recklessness</span>
                    with the first
                    <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>
                    available after it comes off cooldown, and then use one more
                    hard-hitting ability to consume the second charge. Typically the
                    second charge will be spent on
                    <span class="sprite sprite-chain-lightning">Chain Lightning</span> or <span class="sprite sprite-halted-offensive">Halted Offensive</span>
                    since these do the most damage per activation after Thundering
                    Blast, but you can also use it with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-lightning-flash">Lightning Flash</span>
                    or
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span>
                    depending on your health level and the procs you have available.</p>
                <p><span class="sprite sprite-polarity-shift">Polarity Shift</span>
                    does a couple of things. First, literally just increase all your
                    damage by 20% for 20 seconds. Pretty nice. Second, makes you immune
                    to being interrupted or having your casts slowed in any way. Very
                    nice. Third, it increases your alacrity (as in, your cast and GCD
                    speed) by 20%. Oh and did I forget to mention? It doubles your
                    movement speed. Just casual. Basically, this is your godmode button.
                    It can turn the tide of duels, let you kite out enemies so badly
                    you literally break combat and regen to full, get you kills on
                    unsuspecting stealthers&hellip; the possibilities are truly endless.
                    That said, you&apos;ll normally use it in the opener to hit like a
                    goddamn truck, and after that you can find creative uses for it the
                    second time it comes up. Push this button off cooldown while
                    freecasting.</p>
                <h3 id="target-selection">Target Selection</h3>
                <p>As an arena player, your first target should obviously be any
                    that comes in egregiously unprepared and doesn&apos;t pop their
                    defensive cooldowns properly. However, barring a situation like
                    that, it&apos;s useful to know which classes are easiest for you
                    to hit in this spec. These will be as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Snipers.</strong>
                            Already in 6.0 Lightning Sorcs could destroy
                            snipers through pretty much all of their cooldowns, and
                            in 7.0 the only thing that&apos;s changed is that they
                            have fewer of them. Watch for rolls and avoid hitting your
                            major burst into them, but otherwise a sniper is basically
                            a parse dummy with no ability to recover its health (as
                            long as you remember to chase phase walk, that is.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Mercenaries.</strong>
                            Mercs don&apos;t actually have bad defensives,
                            but the damage toolkit you get as Lightning is essentially
                            a hard counter to their best protections. Since
                            <span class="sprite sprite-chain-lightning">Chain Lightning</span> / <span class="sprite sprite-halted-offensive">Halted Offensive</span>
                            is counted as AOE (area of effect) damage by the game&apos;s
                            internal mechanisms, it can be hit through a merc&apos;s
                            reflect for the full damage, and without healing the merc.
                            It also will not give the merc healing stacks on Energy
                            Shield. The ideal combination to hit through either of
                            these cooldowns is a hardcasted
                            <span class="sprite sprite-chain-lightning">Chain Lightning</span> / <span class="sprite sprite-halted-offensive">Halted Offensive</span>,
                            followed by a full
                            <span class="sprite sprite-force-storm">Force Storm</span>,
                            followed by another
                            <span class="sprite sprite-chain-lightning">Chain Lightning</span> / <span class="sprite sprite-halted-offensive">Halted Offensive</span>.
                            You can also apply
                            <span class="sprite sprite-polarity-shift">Polarity Shift</span>
                            to the entire combination, and
                            <span class="sprite sprite-recklessness">Recklessness</span>
                            after the hardcast in order to cause additional devastation.
                            After this combo you can go into casting
                            <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>
                            since at this point the DCD will be over by the time the
                            cast finishes. The ideal situation to surprise a merc in
                            this way is to hold your offensive cooldowns (or even wait
                            to open) until they have popped reflect, and then use the
                            combination above to drop them at least 200k HP through it.
                            Kolto Overload, on the other hand, cannot be easily
                            counterplayed unless the merc pops it at too low of a
                            health percentage, so it&apos;s generally best to swap
                            targets when it is popped (only for the 8 seconds though).</li>
                        <li><strong>Concealment Operatives</strong>
                            (note: make sure you know their
                            spec.) The root profile of Lightning&apos;s attacks is
                            ideal for making a conc op&apos;s life hell. When hitting
                            a conc op, make sure to delay your GCD a bit (like 0.1s)
                            in order to determine whether they will spend their GCD
                            on a roll (which will resist whatever you use), and then
                            if and only if they use it on something else (like an
                            attack of their own, or a kolto probe), use offensive
                            abilities on them. If they roll, you can use a heal on
                            yourself or a teammate to pass the empty GCD, or
                            <span class="sprite sprite-consuming-darkness">Consuming Darkness</span>
                            to regenerate some force (only if you are low on it.)
                            Ensure that you keep the operative rooted with
                            <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>
                            and
                            <span class="sprite sprite-overload">Overload</span>
                            so that you can use casted attacks on them. Generally you
                            will want to start with Thundering Blast because its
                            cooldown is shorter, and re-root with Overload if the
                            operative purges the effect via Evasion or Holotraverse.
                            If the operative breaks the second root, you can apply a
                            third whenever your
                            <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>
                            comes off cooldown, and then have your way with the
                            operative. It is also fairly safe to stun an operative
                            while they are rooted, as they cannot roll it. To maximize
                            control, I recommend using one casted attack while the
                            operative is rooted, and following it with
                            <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                            and 3 more hard-hitting attacks. See the "Locking Down"
                            section below for one very effective way to chain your
                            controlling effects (of several possible).</li>
                        <li><strong>Powertechs.</strong>
                            PT defensives are almost entirely armor-based,
                            which means that you as a Lightning Sorc barely care about
                            them at all. If the powertech pops Emergency Power (the
                            glowing white bubble around themselves), treat it like an
                            operative rolling for 2 GCDs (ignore them, do something
                            else that&apos;s useful), and then go back to dumpstering.
                            If they pop Kolto Overload at high health, they will most
                            likely live through it, so you should swap targets for 8
                            seconds. If they pop it at low (sub-20%) health, you can
                            definitely kill them through it if your team has eyes, so
                            full speed ahead. Killing a powertech is slow, but you
                            will almost always succeed. PTs are much more of a
                            defensive than an offensive problem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Juggernauts.</strong>
                            Juggs are like PTs but with more healing and
                            less potential to kill anything. You <em>can</em> go them
                            and much like PTs they will eventually die, but normally
                            your team will kill them anyway and it&apos;s more useful
                            to use your damage profile on something that&apos;s a
                            bigger threat. That said, if your teammates are ignoring
                            a jugg that&apos;s low or has spend DCDs, certainly don&apos;t
                            just let it heal.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Assassins.</strong>
                            Killing sins takes forever. They have three
                            health bars and normally will hide in stealth until getting
                            a fourth. However, they are such an offensive threat that
                            normally it is actually advantageous to sacrifice that
                            damage in order to take them off the playing field. It
                            can be equally useful to just peel them off when they
                            first come out of stealth and deny their autocrit window,
                            however, without wasting damage on them (which they will
                            just heal).</li>
                        <li><strong>Marauders.</strong>
                            Killing maras is a nightmare for your damage
                            profile. They have great ways to reduce and negate the
                            types of damage sorcs deal, and will most likely attempt
                            a regen once they are finally low as well. You must chase
                            and deny them this regen or your odds of winning the round
                            plummet. Arena teammates almost never assist with chasing,
                            so this can be a brutalizing exercise since marauders are
                            a faster class than sorcs. It can be done with enough
                            persistence, however.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lethality Operatives.</strong>
                            Don&apos;t waste your damage, they
                            will just heal through all of it.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3 id="chasing">Chasing</h3>
                <p>When you start investing damage into a target, it&apos;s incredibly
                    important that you do not then allow this target to escape and
                    heal, wasting all of the resources you spent damaging them. If you
                    are not the enemy team&apos;s focus target, it is your
                    responsibility to chase down players that attempt to run away from
                    your team, such as marauders using their camouflage, or snipers
                    and other sorcs using
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>. There
                    are very common locations on each map where players go to try and
                    heal, but until you learn these there are a number of ways to
                    track these players down by hand.</p>
                <h4>Minimap</h4>
                <p>The minimap will show a red dot for each enemy player in combat
                    with you. If one of these is far to one side, chances are it is a
                    player trying to escape combat, and you should chase it down.</p>
                <h4>Name-Clicking</h4>
                <p>Camouflage will forcibly remove a player from your target, making
                    them difficult to find again. However, spam clicking their name in
                    the enemy players frame can counteract, this causing you to
                    re-target them as soon as they reappear. You can then do a quick
                    walk in all four directions, and whichever one makes the number
                    of meters between you and them (shown on the player frame)
                    decrease is the direction you should head in order to chase them.</p>
                <h4>Seeing Dots</h4>
                <p>Seeing as we are applying a permanent dot to our targets before
                    hitting them, it is also quite common to see yellow flytext
                    numbers through walls or in remote parts of the map. This means
                    an enemy player is hiding behind said wall, and you should finish
                    them off.</p>
                <h3 id="lock-down">Locking Down</h3>
                <p>When a player runs from you, the majority of the time they will
                    attempt to keep running once you reach them. Since we are speccing
                    into two different roots, the following combination of abilities
                    will allow you to prevent a player from moving for an obscene
                    amount of time, and may also cause them to throw a rage fit. You
                    can also stun them afterward with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                    if you have it available in order to get maximum lockdown value.

                <p>If you are a new player chasing down a more experienced one, there
                    is a good chance they will be able to turn it around on you, even
                    with a significant health disadvantage. If that happens, it&apos;s
                    advisable to disengage in order to survive&mdash;a stalemate is
                    better for your team than being down a player. However, you should
                    take note of what happened and how they managed to do what they
                    did. There are a million niche kiting tricks in this game and
                    the only way to learn them is going head-to-head with better
                    players. Remember: being beaten is not the same thing as throwing.
                    Throwing would be not attempting to chase the player at all. Just
                    recognize when you&apos;ve been beaten, learn from your mistakes,
                    and you will improve dramatically in a short period of time.</p>

                <h2>Defense</h2>
                <p>If you&apos;ve ever watched very good sorcs like
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u9OEtQPkWY">Durmoth</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZvA4knb12M">Lyala</a>
                    play in 5.0 and 6.0, you will notice they play with a very
                    peculiar style&mdash;they play slowly, tactically, control their
                    opponents extensively, use line-of-sight objects to minimize
                    incoming damage, and only expose themselves to fire when their
                    targets are particularly vulerable, having no defensive cooldowns
                    active. This is the prototypical way to play a sorcerer. You have
                    no particularly notable defensive cooldowns of your own, only
                    repositioning tools and stun breakers, so you must play
                    intelligently and leverage your positioning and your ability to
                    move while not stunned in order to outplay the DCDs of your
                    opponents. In 6.0 this playstyle was essentially optional. It was
                    advantageous, but you could fare pretty well just pretending to be
                    a marauder and charging in nose-first. In 7.0, if you wish to play
                    Lightning, it is absolutely mandatory. Your positioning is critical
                    because your ability to regenerate health is extremely limited, so
                    taking unnecessary damage can cripple you for the remainder of the
                    round. Likewise, since your health and force pool is so limited,
                    when opportunities to break combat and regenerate them with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-seethe">Seethe</span>
                    present themselves, they are invaluable.
                </p>
                <h3 id="unnatural-pres"><span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span></h3>
                <p>Before we even get into the macro-gameplay of sorc defensives,
                    let me introduce you to my number one pet peeve when watching other
                    sorcs play. This is my friend
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span>.
                    What Unnatural Preservation does, is heal you. No strings attached.
                    It does not cost force, it does not use a GCD, it has a very short
                    cooldown, and you can even spend
                    <span class="sprite sprite-recklessness">Recklessness</span>
                    on it to make it heal more. The sooner you use it, the faster it
                    comes off cooldown, and the sooner you can use it again. By
                    delaying this you are literally wasting healing for no reason,
                    and also causing me to despise you on a personal level. In short,
                    if you are below 90% health,
                    <strong>PUSH THIS FUCKING BUTTON IMMEDIATELY</strong>.
                    Now, with that said&hellip;
                </p>
                <h3 id="major-dcds">Major Defensive Cooldowns</h3>
                <p>As a sorc, you have three (two and a half, really) defensive
                    cooldowns that will help you out of big trouble. These are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-barrier">Force Barrier</span>, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unbreakable-will">Unbreakable Will</span>.
                    The ideal cooldown rotation would have you use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>
                    the first time you are stunned,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unbreakable-will">Unbreakable Will</span>
                    some time later if you are caught up to and stunned again, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-barrier">Force Barrier</span>
                    on whitebar if you are restunned after that. This is ideal, but
                    not always possible, so at minimum make sure to use all three of
                    these before you die. Major cooldowns are really only necessary
                    when you are caught in a stun (or a very nasty root), however,
                    so when you are un-stunned you should be using
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                    to position yourself so that you take the minimum possible damage.
                    This process is called kiting, and we will cover it in the next
                    section.

                <p>If there are multiple people
                    chasing you, you always want to be hitting the closest one in
                    order to slow them down, but know that in this situation it is
                    only a matter of time before you die, and plan accordingly to
                    extract breakers, defensive cooldowns, et cetera from the people
                    chasing you.</p>
