                <h2>The Lightning Playstyle</h2>
                <p>Before getting started with lightning you should know this: if
                    you&apos;ve heard things about the spec being strong or
                    overpowered, these are relics from 6.0 when it was indeed quite
                    strong. Lightning was traditionally a jack-of-all-trades kind of
                    spec: decent damage, decent survivability, decent control of enemy
                    players, decent AOE potential, et cetera; but not the best in any
                    of these categories. However, with the release of 7.0 it faces a
                    glaring survivability problem, as well as doing comparatively
                    much worse damage than in previous patches, so we will have to
                    make sacrifices in all secondary areas to compensate for these
                    newfound weaknesses. If you want to feel like Emperor Palpatine
                    and steamroll people effortlessly, respec to
                    <a href="/madness.html">madness</a> immediately
                    and don&apos;t bother to continue reading&mdash;this spec does not
                    have what you are looking for. That said, if you prefer a more
                    tactical, conservative playstyle involving outplaying defensive
                    cooldowns, choosing your opportunity windows, and reducing your
                    damage taken by way of positioning, or you just enjoy the brutal
                    sounds of firing off a different kind of lightning bolt with every
                    GCD, this spec does still have something to offer, and I will show
                    you how to force it into viability.</p>

                <h2>Viable Lightning Builds</h2>
                <p>There are essentially only two ways to build lightning without
                    becoming worm food every time a marauder so much as looks at you,
                    which we&apos;ll take a look at in a second. Both will use the
                    same gear and legendary implants, though with different tacticals.</p>
                <div id="build-gear">
                    <h3>Stim</h3>
                    <p>Use Advanced Kyrprax Versatile Stim. Do not pass go, do not
                        collect two hundred dollars.</p>
                    <h3>Gear and Set Bonus</h3>
                    <p>The gearing strategy is actually quite simple. For legendaries,
                        you want <strong>Gathering Storm Package</strong> and
                        <strong>Unmatched Haste Package</strong>, in that order.
                        Without Gathering Storm, Unmatched Haste barely does anything
                        for you, so prioritize Gathering Storm.</p>
                    <p>For regular gear, you want the best item level gear you can get
                        at any point in time. I recommend using the <strong>1.3 GCD</strong>
                        alacrity build, which will require 6 alacrity pieces, one of
                        which is your Gathering Storm implant. Thus, in addition to
                        your legendaries, you will need to get <strong>5 alacrity</strong>
                        enhancements and <strong>4 critical</strong> enhancements.
                        The moddable gear vendor <strong>Hyde and Zeek</strong> is far
                        and away the easiest way to do this, it isn&apos;t worth
                        bothering with any other method.</p>
                    <div class="multiplex">
                        <div class="mux-frame">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Augments</h3>
                    <p>If you use the build I&apos;ve prescribed, all of your augments
                        should be crit augments. If you&apos;re freestyling,
                        you&apos;ll want to use augments to reach the proper stat
                        thresholds, that being 3209 alacrity (for 1.3 second GCD) or
                        560 alacrity (for 1.4 second GCD); the rest of your stats go
                        into crit. Do not use accuracy on a sorcerer in PvP, it is a
                        complete waste of stats.</p>

                <div id="build-burst">
                    <h2>The Burst Build</h2>
                    <p>The first is a tactical, burst-cannon build with a lot of roots
                        and control to attempt to minimize the uptime enemy players have
                        on you, as compared to you on them. With this build you will
                        essentially have to duel anyone that tabs onto you in order to
                        force them to disengage or die.</p>
                    <h3>Tactical Item</h3>
                    <p>You will be running the <strong>Eyrin&apos;s Haste</strong>
                        tactical, and using the instant Thundering Blast it provides
                        as a root, with a bit of burst damage baked in on top.</p>

                        for either of the other options in that tier if you have a use

                        (good AOE potential for example).</p>

                <div id="build-cleave">
                    <h2>The Cleave Build</h2>
                    <p>The second build is a very tanky, but support-reliant and
                        immobile setup with the potential to output devastating AOE
                        damage and destroy an entire team. While on 90% of occasions
                        I recommend playing the first build, if you find yourself with
                        a competent tank and healer, this build can output devastating
                        pressure. It was mostly used for group ranked, but it&apos;s
                        worth documenting here because it can be a premade-buster with
                        proper support. With this build you should be using
                        <span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span>
                        and

                        as soon as they are available, and using

                        to supplement your already high passive damage reduction when
                        major burst is on the way. You should also use
                        <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                        and
                        <span class="sprite sprite-overload">Overload</span>
                        to create distance and take cover from enemy ranged fire, as
                        always, but you will have limited opportunities to do so with
                        this build.</p>
                    <h3>Tactical Item</h3>
                    <p>You will be running the <strong>Elemental Convection</strong>
                        tactical, which will reset the cooldown of

                        and

                        This will ensure you never delay the proc, always do maximum

                        quicker. If there are multiple consistent targets, you will

                        <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                        to all of them, as you will passively refresh it resulting in

                <h3>Abilities</h3>
                <p>Lightning has six rotational rotational attacks which you will use
                    frequently. These are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>,

                    <span class="sprite sprite-chain-lightning">Chain Lightning</span> or
                    <span class="sprite sprite-halted-offensive">Halted Offensive</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-shock">Shock</span>, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-lightning-bolt">Lightning Bolt</span>.
                </p>
                <p>There are also two non-rotational abilities that you may use for
                    niche purposes or with certain builds (such as the cleave build).
                    These are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-lightning">Force Lightning</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-volt-rush">Volt Rush</span>.</p>
                <h3>Pre-Rotation: Apply Affliction</h3>
                <p>Before attacking a target, ensure that it has your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                    applied to it. Turning on <em>&quot;Highlight Personal Debuffs&quot;</em>
                    in the UI editor is a very easy way to track this (it will glow
                    gold.) Your affliction will refresh, so you don&apos;t need to use
                    it in rotation, but attacking a target without it on is very very
                    bad. Affliction causes your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-thundering-blast">Thundering Blast</span>
                    to autocrit, which accounts for a great deal of your burst damage.
                    Do not forget it!
                </p>
                <h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>
                <p>The &quot;rotation&quot; for Lightning is just a priority system.

                <h3 id="chasing">Chasing</h3>
                <p>When you start investing damage into a target, it&apos;s incredibly
                    important that you do not then allow this target to escape and
                    heal, wasting all of the resources you spent damaging them. If you
                    are not the enemy team&apos;s focus target, it is your
                    responsibility to chase down players that attempt to run away from
                    your team, such as marauders using their camouflage, or snipers
                    and other sorcs using
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>. There
                    are very common locations on each map where players go to try and
                    heal, but until you learn these there are a number of ways to
                    track these players down by hand.</p>
                <h4>Minimap</h4>
                <p>The minimap will show a red dot for each enemy player in combat
                    with you. If one of these is far to one side, chances are it is a
                    player trying to escape combat, and you should chase it down.</p>
                <h4>Name-Clicking</h4>
                <p>Camouflage will forcibly remove a player from your target, making
                    them difficult to find again. However, spam clicking their name in
                    the enemy players frame can counteract, this causing you to
                    re-target them as soon as they reappear. You can then do a quick
                    walk in all four directions, and whichever one makes the number
                    of meters between you and them (shown on the player frame)
                    decrease is the direction you should head in order to chase them.</p>
                <h4>Seeing Dots</h4>
                <p>Seeing as we are applying a permanent dot to our targets before
                    hitting them, it is also quite common to see yellow flytext
                    numbers through walls or in remote parts of the map. This means
                    an enemy player is hiding behind said wall, and you should finish
                    them off.</p>
                <h3 id="lock-down">Locking Down</h3>
                <p>When a player runs from you, the majority of the time they will
                    attempt to keep running once you reach them. Since we are speccing
                    into two different roots, the following combination of abilities
                    will allow you to prevent a player from moving for an obscene
                    amount of time, and may also cause them to throw a rage fit. You
                    can also stun them afterward with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                    if you have it available in order to get maximum lockdown value.

                <p>If you are a new player chasing down a more experienced one, there
                    is a good chance they will be able to turn it around on you, even
                    with a significant health disadvantage. If that happens, it&apos;s
                    advisable to disengage in order to survive&mdash;a stalemate is
                    better for your team than being down a player. However, you should
                    take note of what happened and how they managed to do what they
                    did. There are a million niche kiting tricks in this game and
                    the only way to learn them is going head-to-head with better
                    players. Remember: being beaten is not the same thing as throwing.
                    Throwing would be not attempting to chase the player at all. Just
                    recognize when you&apos;ve been beaten, learn from your mistakes,
                    and you will improve dramatically in a short period of time.</p>

                <h3>Kiting</h3>
                <p>If there are multiple people
                    chasing you, you always want to be hitting the closest one in
                    order to slow them down, but know that in this situation it is
                    only a matter of time before you die, and plan accordingly to
                    extract breakers, defensive cooldowns, et cetera from the people
                    chasing you.</p>
