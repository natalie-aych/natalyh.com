                <h2>The Madness Playstyle</h2>
                <p>Let&apos;s not beat around the bush here. This spec is insane right
                    now. You can win 1v2s, 1v3s, facetank and heal through people's
                    entire rotations, and generally outside of a PT, a rage jugg, or
                    a deception assassin hitting you, have nothing to worry about as
                    long as you do the rotation correctly to keep getting healed. That
                    said, even though you can literally roll your face on the keyboard
                    and do pretty well on this spec, if you elect to play it
                    intelligently and kite rather than facetank, there is EVEN MORE
                    that you can do to make an enemy team&apos;s life completely
                    miserable. What I will attempt to do in this guide is show you
                    how to make the most out of a spec that already gives a lot
                    without much effort. If you follow along, you will almost
                    certainly have people raging at you in general chat after matches,
                    which is of course the highest form of flattery.
                </p>
                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>Be warned, however: I&apos;m not nearly as good at madness as I am
                    at <a href="/lightning">lightning</a> or
                    <a href="/corruption">corruption</a>. I have probably one
                    one-hundredth the hours played on this as the other two. Therefore,
                    what I will try to show you is not so much madness-specific
                    trickery, but rather how to apply the fundamentals of the sorcerer
                    class using the abilities this spec provides.

                <h2>Viable Madness Builds</h2>
                <p>At difference to lightning, you can pretty much build this spec any
                    way your heart desires and still do pretty well. However, there
                    are still two primary builds I recommend that will perform better
                    than others, and of course it never hurts to have your gear
                    correct either.
                </p>
                <div id="build-gear">
                    <h3>Stim</h3>
                    <p>Use Advanced Kyrprax Versatile Stim. Do not pass go, do not
                        collect two hundred dollars.</p>
                    <h3>Gear and Set Bonus</h3>
                    <p>The gearing strategy is actually quite simple. For legendaries,
                        you want <strong>Gathering Storm Package</strong> and
                        <strong>Unmatched Haste Package</strong>, in that order.
                        Without Gathering Storm, Unmatched Haste barely does anything
                        for you, so prioritize Gathering Storm.</p>
                    <p>For regular gear, you want the best item level gear you can get
                        at any point in time. I recommend using the <strong>1.4 GCD</strong>
                        alacrity build, which will require 4 alacrity pieces, one of
                        which is your Gathering Storm implant. Thus, in addition to
                        your legendaries, you will need to get <strong>3 alacrity</strong>
                        enhancements and <strong>5 critical</strong> enhancements.
                        The moddable gear vendor <strong>Hyde and Zeek</strong> is far
                        and away the easiest way to do this, it isn&apos;t worth
                        bothering with any other method.</p>

                    <p>If you use the build I&apos;ve prescribed, all of your augments
                        should be crit augments. If you&apos;re freestyling,
                        you&apos;ll want to use augments to reach the proper stat
                        threshold, that being 2054 alacrity. The rest of your stats go
                        into crit. Do not use accuracy on a sorcerer in PvP, it is a
                        complete waste of stats. You can spill over a bit on alacrity
                        which will help to compensate for poor latency or a bad
                        connection.</p>

                        the time&mdash;it has good dot spread potential, so you&apos;re
                        able to farm damage, the survivability is solid, and if you
                        push it to its limit it even has the capacity to win 1v2 and

                        slightly higher than
                        <span class="sprite sprite-demolish">Demolish</span>,
                        as the latter can now only hit one target. You will also never

                        with this build, preferring to use a partial channel of

                <h3>Level 64 Choice</h3>
                <p>Depending what you&apos;re playing against, it may be advantageous
                    to swap out <strong>Backlash</strong> at level 64 for
                    <strong>Unnatural Vigor</strong>. Generally, more ranged classes,
                    juggernauts, and marauders will warrant a swap to
                    <strong>Unnatural Vigor</strong>, while more stealthers will
                    warrant a swap to <strong>Backlash</strong>. Given how immobile
                    the madness rotation is, you generally won&apos;t get full value
                    from the mobility provided by <strong>Surging Speed</strong>, but
                    you&apos;re welcome to play with it and it certainly won&apos;t be
                    a bad option in any case.

                    unfortunately does not line up very cleanly with the madness

                    charges critting a multi-target

                    it isn&apos;t a huge loss. Realistically, madness&apos;s damage
                    profile is so flat that there isn&apos;t any ability which it
                    would be grievously incorrect to spend a Recklessness charge on.
                    If you&apos;re low on health, you can even spend it on
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span>
                    to quickly get back to a more sustainable level.</p>
                <p><span class="sprite sprite-polarity-shift">Polarity Shift</span>
                    does a couple of things. First, literally just increase all your
                    damage by 20% for 20 seconds. Pretty nice. Second, makes you immune
                    to being interrupted or having your casts slowed in any way. Very
                    nice. Third, it increases your alacrity (as in, your cast and GCD
                    speed) by 20%. Like Recklessness, this ability does less for you
                    on madness than lightning, but still push this button off cooldown
                    while doing damage.</p>

                </ol>
                <h3 id="heal-allocation">Heal Allocation</h3>
                <p>It&apos;s important to note that simply doing your opening combo
                    of
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span> and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-death-field">Death Field</span> or
                    <span class="sprite sprite-death-brand">Death Brand</span>
                    with all the appropriate buffs will heal you close to 100,000
                    health. If there is any chance that you will take damage in the
                    near future, you want to delay at very least the
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>
                    until your health is lower and you can get some value out of its
                    heal. In the meantime you can use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-lightning">Force Lightning</span>
                    to proc and apply
                    <span class="sprite sprite-demolish">Demolish</span>.
                    An excellent example of this is when two madness sorcs of similar
                    skill duel, the one that uses
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>
                    at 100% health will almost always lose due to the opposing sorc
                    healing off all the damage from his opener. Be mindful of this
                    and it will win you a lot of otherwise even exchanges.</p>
                <h3 id="target-selection">Target Selection</h3>
                <p>As an arena player, your first target should obviously be any
                    that comes in egregiously unprepared and doesn&apos;t pop their
                    defensive cooldowns properly. However, barring a situation like
                    that, it&apos;s useful to know which classes are easiest for you
                    to hit in this spec. These will be as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Snipers.</strong>
                            Snipers&apos; DCDs are, in no uncertain terms, pitiful,
                            when pitted against your damage profile. Sniper
                            defense is grounded in the ability to roll and avoid spike
                            damage, then shield the very little additional damage that
                            comes their way outside of these spikes. Your damage graph,
                            however, looks like a straight line&mdash;it doesn&apos;t
                            have any spikes, so there is nothing good for them to roll
                            besides
                            <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>.
                            As such, I recommend just avoiding
                            <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>
                            altogether when tunneling a sniper in order to make their
                            life maximally miserable (and minimally lengthy).</li>
                        <li><strong>AP Powertechs.</strong>
                            AP defensives are almost entirely armor-based,
                            which means that you as a dot spec barely care about
                            them at all. If the powertech pops Emergency Power (the
                            glowing white bubble around themselves), use it as a
                            window to refresh your dots on them, generate Wrath stacks
                            to proc your next
                            <span class="sprite sprite-demolish">Demolish</span>,
                            or treat it like an operative rolling for 2 GCDs (ignore
                            them, do something else that&apos;s useful), and then go
                            back to dumpstering. Unlike as lightning, you don&apos;t
                            have much burst to chunk through Kolto Overload, so
                            generally it is a good idea to swap targets when it&apos;s
                            popped. However, if the powertech makes a mistake and pops
                            it in the single-digit health percentage range, some good
                            old fashioned
                            <span class="sprite sprite-force-lightning">Force Lightning</span>
                            spam should be enough to finish them off through it.
                            Killing a powertech is slow, but you will almost always
                            succeed. AP is much more of a defensive than an
                            offensive problem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Juggernauts.</strong>
                            Juggs are like PTs but with more healing and
                            less potential to kill anything. You <em>can</em> go them
                            and much like PTs they will eventually die, but normally
                            your team will kill them anyway and it&apos;s more useful
                            to use your damage profile on something that&apos;s a
                            bigger threat. That said, if your teammates are ignoring
                            a jugg that&apos;s low or has spent DCDs, certainly don&apos;t
                            just let it heal.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mercenaries.</strong>
                            Mercs don&apos;t actually have bad defensives,
                            but there&apos;s very little they can do against dots and
                            AOE damage, which you have a great deal of. When a merc
                            pops energy shield or reflect, use it as an opportunity
                            to reapply your dots to them, and use
                            <span class="sprite sprite-death-field">Death Field</span></li>
                            if you&apos;re taking it. Do not use
                            <span class="sprite sprite-death-brand">Death Brand</span>,
                            however, as it is classsified as single-target damage and
                            will give them a heal. Kolto Overload there isn&apos;t
                            much you can do about, so just reapply dots during it and
                            swap to another target.
                        <li><strong>Marauders.</strong>
                            Killing maras is much nicer on madness than lightning.
                            Don&apos;t really have much recourse against your dots,
                            which will slowly eat them away and delay their ability
                            to heal out of combat when they vanish. As long as you
                            don&apos;t hit into Undying Rage (just swap targets), and
                            chase them down after they vanish, marauders should be a
                            slow but reliable kill target.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pyro PTs</strong>
                            While Powertechs are normally easy enough to kill,
                            pyrotech&apos;s passive defenses against dot damage make
                            them hellish for you to kill. While they can&apos;t
                            actually purge your dots like the specs lower down the
                            list, they will take 30% less damage from them at baseline,
                            in addition to farming multiple koltos from your extremely
                            flat damage profile. Unless you have multiple burst spec
                            teammates that you trust to survive the powertech&apos;s
                            onslaught (in order to catch it between koltos), I
                            recommend selecting a different target.</li>
                        <li><strong>Concealment Operatives</strong>
                            Operatives are kind of a nightmare to tunnel as a dot spec.
                            Their ability to purge your dots every 20 seconds, combined
                            with their hots, and the fact that you need to cast and
                            channel very predictable sources of damage makes it very
                            inconvenient to do damage to them. Nevertheless, if the
                            operative is specced into concealment (make sure you know
                            this for certain), their lack of damage reduction and your
                            near limitless ability to facetank damage will actually
                            render this a winning matchup for you. When hitting
                            a conc op, make sure to delay your GCD a bit (like 0.1s)
                            in order to determine whether they will spend their GCD
                            on a roll (which will resist whatever you use), and then
                            if and only if they use it on something else (like an
                            attack of their own, or a kolto probe), use offensive
                            abilities on them. If they roll, you can use a heal on
                            yourself or a teammate to pass the empty GCD. Since your
                            burst (outside of dots) comes primarily from
                            <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>,
                            you will need to fake cast leech and interrupt it yourself
                            in order to bait the operative&apos;s rolls, before you
                            can actually get it off.
                            Ensure that you keep the operative rooted with
                            <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                            and
                            <span class="sprite sprite-overload">Overload</span>
                            so that you can use casted attacks on them. Generally you
                            will want to start with Creeping Terror because its
                            cooldown is shorter, and re-root with Overload if the
                            operative purges the effect via Evasion or Holotraverse.
                            If the operative breaks the second root, you can apply a
                            third whenever your
                            <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                            comes off cooldown, and then have your way with the
                            operative. It is also fairly safe to stun an operative
                            while they are rooted, as they cannot roll it. To maximize
                            control, I recommend using
                            <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>
                            while the operative is rooted, and following it with
                            <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                            and a full cast of

                            Killing sins takes forever. They have three
                            health bars and normally will hide in stealth until getting
                            a fourth. They will also use Force Shroud to purge your
                            dots and avoid your burst windows, and you do not posess
                            the burst potential in this spec to make them panic. Avoid
                            tunneling them unless they have wasted vanishes
                            frivolously or there is no better target available.

                <h3 id="chasing">Chasing</h3>
                <p>When you start investing damage into a target, it&apos;s incredibly
                    important that you do not then allow this target to escape and
                    heal, wasting all of the resources you spent damaging them. If you
                    are not the enemy team&apos;s focus target, it is your
                    responsibility to chase down players that attempt to run away from
                    your team, such as marauders using their camouflage, or snipers
                    and other sorcs using
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>. There
                    are very common locations on each map where players go to try and
                    heal, but until you learn these there are a number of ways to
                    track these players down by hand.</p>
                <h4>Minimap</h4>
                <p>The minimap will show a red dot for each enemy player in combat
                    with you. If one of these is far to one side, chances are it is a
                    player trying to escape combat, and you should chase it down.</p>
                <h4>Name-Clicking</h4>
                <p>Camouflage will forcibly remove a player from your target, making
                    them difficult to find again. However, spam clicking their name in
                    the enemy players frame can counteract, this causing you to
                    re-target them as soon as they reappear. You can then do a quick
                    walk in all four directions, and whichever one makes the number
                    of meters between you and them (shown on the player frame)
                    decrease is the direction you should head in order to chase them.</p>
                <h4>Seeing Dots</h4>
                <p>Seeing as we are applying a permanent dot to our targets before
                    hitting them, it is also quite common to see yellow flytext
                    numbers through walls or in remote parts of the map. This means
                    an enemy player is hiding behind said wall, and you should finish
                    them off.</p>
                <h3 id="lock-down">Locking Down</h3>
                <p>When a player runs from you, the majority of the time they will
                    attempt to keep running once you reach them. Since we are given
                    two different roots, the following combination of abilities
                    will allow you to prevent a player from moving for an obscene
                    amount of time, and may also cause them to throw a rage fit. You
                    can also stun them afterward with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                    if you have it available in order to get maximum lockdown value.

                </ol>
                <p>You can also use the following combination in tandem with the
                    Backlash talent to punish a melee player that attempts to sit on
                    or 1v1 you.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="sprite sprite-static-barrier">Static Barrier</span></li>
                    <li><span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span></li>
                    <li><span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span></li>

                    <li><span class="sprite sprite-death-field">Death Field</span> or
                        <span class="sprite sprite-death-brand">Death Brand</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>This will set up all your dots and debuffs, as well as heal off any
                    opening damage they may have been able to put on you, without the
                    enemy player having any recourse whatsoever (unless they waste
                    their stun breaker, in which case you can restun with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                    and kill them in short order.) Madness is one of the best dueling
                    specs in the game right now, do not hesitate to punish someone for
                    trying to challenge that. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="getting-owned">Getting Owned</h3>
                <p>If you are a new player chasing down a more experienced one, there
                    is a good chance they will be able to turn it around on you, even
                    with a significant health disadvantage. If that happens, it&apos;s
                    advisable to disengage in order to survive&mdash;a stalemate is
                    better for your team than being down a player. However, you should
                    take note of what happened and how they managed to do what they
                    did. There are a million niche kiting tricks in this game and
                    the only way to learn them is going head-to-head with better
                    players. Remember: being beaten is not the same thing as throwing.
                    Throwing would be not attempting to chase the player at all. Just
                    recognize when you&apos;ve been beaten, learn from your mistakes,
                    and you will improve dramatically in a short period of time.</p>

                <h2>Defense</h2>
                <p>If you&apos;ve ever watched very good sorcs like
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u9OEtQPkWY">Durmoth</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZvA4knb12M">Lyala</a>
                    play in 5.0 and 6.0, you will notice they play with a very
                    peculiar style&mdash;they play slowly, tactically, control their
                    opponents extensively, use line-of-sight objects to minimize
                    incoming damage, and only expose themselves to fire when their
                    targets are particularly vulerable, having no defensive cooldowns
                    active. This is the prototypical way to play a sorcerer. You have
                    no particularly notable defensive cooldowns of your own, only
                    repositioning tools and stun breakers. While in this spec you can
                    afford to use these tools as panic buttons because they have a
                    considerable amount of healing attached, it will pay much greater
                    dividends to play intelligently and leverage your positioning and
                    your ability to move and heal passively while not stunned, in
                    order to outplay the DCDs of your opponents and strike at their
                    weak points. This playstyle is essentially optional at the moment.
                    Given the strength of madness you can win almost any engagement
                    pretending to be a powertech and charging in nose-first. That
                    said, actually playing like a proper sorcerer will supercharge the
                    already hyper-strong kit available to you and make you feel like
                    you have superpowers.
                </p>
                <h3 id="unnatural-pres"><span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span></h3>
                <p>Before we even get into the macro-gameplay of sorc defensives,
                    let me introduce you to my number one pet peeve when watching other
                    sorcs play. This is my friend
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unnatural-preservation">Unnatural Preservation</span>.
                    What Unnatural Preservation does, is heal you. No strings attached.
                    It does not cost force, it does not use a GCD, it has a very short
                    cooldown, and you can even spend
                    <span class="sprite sprite-recklessness">Recklessness</span>
                    on it to make it heal more. The sooner you use it, the faster it
                    comes off cooldown, and the sooner you can use it again. By
                    delaying this you are literally wasting healing for no reason,
                    and also causing me to despise you on a personal level. In short,
                    if you are below 90% health,
                    <strong>PUSH THIS FUCKING BUTTON IMMEDIATELY</strong>.
                    While we&apos;re at it, do the same thing with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-static-barrier">Static Barrier</span>,
                    even if you&apos;re at 100%. It&apos;s a shield so it can&apos;t
                    over-heal, and if you&apos;re under 100% it will heal you up at a
                    rate of 1% per second without any intervention by you.
                </p>
                <h3 id="major-dcds">Major Defensive Cooldowns</h3>
                <p>As a sorc, you have three (two and a half, really) defensive
                    cooldowns that will help you out of big trouble. These are
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-barrier">Force Barrier</span>, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unbreakable-will">Unbreakable Will</span>.
                    The ideal cooldown rotation would have you use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>
                    the first time you are stunned,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unbreakable-will">Unbreakable Will</span>
                    some time later if you are caught up to and stunned again, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-barrier">Force Barrier</span>
                    on whitebar if you are restunned after that. This is ideal, but
                    not always possible, so at minimum make sure to use all three of
                    these before you die. Major cooldowns are really only necessary
                    when you are caught in a stun (or a very nasty root), however,
                    so when you are un-stunned you should be using
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                    to repositioning yourself to safety.
                </p>
                <h3 id="kiting">Kiting</h3>
                <p>Your primary defensive strategy on sorc is the art of positioning
                    yourself in such a way that you take as little damage as possible
                    from enemy players. This art is called kiting. In some instances,
                    kiting is very simple. For example, a concealment operative cannot
                    do damage to you if he cannot come within 4 meters of you.
                    Therefore, stay out of that range most of the time and you are
                    safe. Likewise, an arsenal merc can do very little damage to you
                    if he cannot see you through a wall. Therefore, put an object
                    between you and the merc and you should be alright. These are the
                    basic premises for kiting melee and ranged classes&mdash;against
                    melee compositions, you want to place a lot of distance between
                    you and the enemy. Against ranged compositions, you want to place
                    an object between you and the enemy.</p>
                <h4>Mixed Comps</h4>
                <p>In situations where the enemy team is a mixed composition of
                    melee and ranged classes, however, the issue becomes much
                    more complicated. Ideally, you want to place both distance, and
                    an LOS object between yourself and the enemy. Generally the way
                    to do this is to time your usage of
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                    such that you can use it to run away, and then turn a corner of
                    some kind. Some maps are great for this, and others are abysmal.
                    In the latter case, you will have to use some creativity in
                    tandem with the strategies described below in order to escape
                    a tricky situation where you would take unnecessary damage.</p>
                <h4>Baiting Knockbacks</h4>
                <p>One of the greatest ways to juke a team of bad players is to
                    bait them into being knocked off a ledge they can&apos;t easily
                    climb again. The way to execute this is generally to use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                    to take you to a place on the edge of a ledge, and then turn your
                    camera and quickly use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-overload">Overload</span>
                    on the group of enemies that follows. Excellent spots for this
                    include the vent landing area on Mandalorian Battle Ring, the
                    ramps on Orbital Station, and the hut doorways overlooking the pit
                    on Tatooine Canyon.</p> 
                <h4>Grouping Enemies</h4>
                <p>If there are multiple players chasing you, you always want to be
                    hitting the closest one in order to slow it down, and keep the
                    enemies in a nice neat clump. Clumps allow you to use knockbacks
                    and crowd control on multiple targets at once, multiplying their
                    effectiveness.</p>
                <h4>Crowd Control</h4>
                <p>Speaking of which, another great set of tools to ditch chasers are
                    crowd control effects. Since we&apos;ve lost Whirlwind with the
                    launch of 7.0, a sorc&apos;s CC kit essentially consists of
                    <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                    and Seismic Grenades, which you can buy from the GTN. Electrocute
                    should generally be used when there is a single leading chaser
                    catching up to you in order to keep him in line with the pack,
                    while Seismic Grenades can be used to incapacitate the entire pack
                    at once while you make a getaway. However, if a player instantly
                    breaks your Electrocute stun, you can immediately follow it with
                    a Seismic Grenade knowing they will then have to sit for its
                    entire duration, and you can use this time to create distance or
                    heal yourself (the former is recommended). Analogously, you can
                    use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                    on the leading chaser, followed by
                    <span class="sprite sprite-overload">Overload</span>
                    when the group catches up, in order to perform this trick with
                    roots rather than stuns. In general I would try and use the root
                    variation on cooldown, and the stun variation when you have
                    sufficient distance with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>
                    off cooldown to make a legitimate getaway and potentially regen.</p>
                <h4>Phase Walk Usage</h4>
                <p>While the rest of these tools are alright,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>
                    is by far the best defensive ability sorcerers have. Since its
                    cooldown is the shortest of our major DCDs, we would prefer to
                    use it first in order to get a second one off before dying, and
                    in order to do that we need to have it in a solid position before
                    we ever head into combat. This means we cannot sit in spawn like
                    juggernauts or powertechs like to, as being caught without phase
                    walk set is a death sentence.</p>
                <p>When starting off a round as the kill target, the ideal opening is
                    to set Phase Walk at a high level, drop to a lower level, have
                    the enemy team follow you down, and then activate Phase Walk and
                    leave them sitting on the bottom floor like idiots, wasting their
                    entire opening volley of damage (which usually is more than they
                    will do for the rest of the match). This late into the game&apos;s
                    life-cycle, however, people are beginning to get wise to Phase
                    Walk strategies, so after activating it you are likely to be
                    chased. For this reason, ideal Phase Walk spots are both at high
                    altitude, and allow you to escape in multiple directions depending
                    which the enemy team tries to chase you from. From here you can
                    just run farther away and preserve the distance you&apos;ve created
                    until you drop combat and can
                    <span class="sprite sprite-seethe">Seethe</span>
                    yourself to full. This is an ideal situation and will not be
                    possible every time, but at least try to leave yourself room to
                    run away from your phase in the event it gets camped or chased.</p>
                    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don&apos;t Phase Walk into a corner, and don&apos;t Phase
                    Walk where you can be leapt to. I leave the rest up to your
                    imagination.</p>
                <h4>Tab Into Your Attackers</h4>
                <p>The primary thing that sets madness apart from other specs is the
                    fact that simply doing your rotation, with the exception of
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-lightning">Force Lightning</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-demolish">Demolish</span>,
                    on one of the players chasing you, will heal you for approximately
                    5-8k HPS, which is like having your own (unskilled) pocket healer.
                    This entire block can be utilized while moving, and will
                    additionally slow and root your attackers, so it will make you
                    extremely difficult to kill, even before you&apos;ve made use of
                    your major defensives.</p>
                <p>Generally the best practice while kiting is to apply
                    <span class="sprite sprite-static-barrier">Static Barrier</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-resurgence">Resurgence</span>
                    to yourself on cooldown, apply
                    <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                    to the leading chaser every 9s and 18s respectively (half and full
                    dot duration), and utilize
                    <span class="sprite sprite-death-brand">Death Brand</span> or <span class="sprite sprite-death-field">Death Field</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-leech">Force Leech</span>
                    on the leading chaser off cooldown. This will ensure maximum
                    self-healing, rooting, and slowing, all while allowing you to
                    remain mobile and create stall for time and distance.
                </p>
                <h4>General Positioning</h4>
                <p>In addition to active kiting, it is also important as a sorc to be
                    prepared to begin kiting at any second. Being caught out of
                    position (meaning out of range of your Phase Walk or away from
                    any objects you could use to break line-of-sight) can quickly get
                    you killed, or at best force you to spend your defensive cooldowns
                    in an order that greatly reduces your lifespan. Therefore,
                    positioning responsibly while you play sorc entails knowing your
                    Phase Walk range, moving your Phase Walk if you need to chase
                    out of that range, and always staying near an object you can use
                    to break casts and channels targeting you (unless you are in the
                    middle of
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>).</p>
                <h4>Pole-Knocking</h4>
                <p>One last trick which can be very helpful is what I call
                    pole-knocking, that is, getting around a pole, and then doubling
                    back to knock away an enemy that tries to follow. This is a very
                    specific technique but its potential is high, so here is a video
                    to demonstrate me doing it to a jugg.</p>
                <div class="multiplex">

                <h3>Damage Reduction</h3>
                <p>New in 7.0, and a major contributor to its ridiculous strength, is
                    the passive damage reduction that madness gets from having its
                    dots out. Always have your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                    on at least one target at any given time, in order to take 15%
                    less damage from all attacks, blanket statement. This is
                    ridiculously easy to maintain, but be careful not to be caught
                    without it in the opener. Use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>
                    to avoid being caught naked in an opening stun, because this is
                    perhaps the time when you are most vulerable to being bursted, and
                    when the burst damage enemy players are able to produce is the
                    largest.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to its passive DR, which should be active at all times,
                    the builds I have recommended have access to active DR every 45
                    seconds by way of
                    <span class="sprite sprite-cloud-mind">Cloud Mind</span>.
                    Cloud Mind grants 25% additional damage reduction for 6 seconds,
                    and should be used when you anticipate big incoming burst damage.
                    This is an intuition you will develop as you play, but a good rule
                    of thumb is that whenever you are snared or rooted (i.e. it&apos;s
                    hard for your character to move), big damage is on the way
                    shortly.</p>
                <h3>Surviving Net</h3>
                <p>Many new sorcs think they have everything figured out and then
                    suddenly find all their major DCDs grayed out and themselves
                    globaled. This is the result of an ability that Mercenaries have
                    called <strong>Electro Net</strong>. Electro Net lasts 9 seconds,
                    deals a great deal of damage over time, and disables
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-speed">Force Speed</span>,
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span>, and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-barrier">Force Barrier</span>.
                    It can be dispelled by using
                    <span class="sprite sprite-unbreakable-will">Unbreakable Will</span>,
                    but you will have to save your breaker for this purpose. The ideal
                    maneuver when dispelling net in this way is to then Force Speed to a
                    safe location and heal through the dot damage.</p>
                <p>For the most part, as madness you will not actually need to break
                    net unless you have the entire enemy team parsing on you at the
                    same time. Generally your passive offheals will allow you to
                    survive a net just by spending your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-cloud-mind">Cloud Mind</span>
                    and <strong>Warzone Adrenal</strong> on it and continuing your
                    rotation as normal. It can also be helpful to step behind a
                    line-of-sight object, which you should have handy, in order to
                    take cover from the incoming damage. Something I frenquently
                    notice is mercs popping their Responsive Safeguards (reflect)
                    during net, which is a little golden stringy bubble around their
                    character, to try and prevent the use of rotational heals to
                    negate the net. If this happens, you have a number of options
                    available to you. You can simply tab into another target if one
                    is nearby, you can break the net and speed away, you can step
                    behind a line-of-sight object and spam
                    <span class="sprite sprite-dark-heal">Dark Heal</span>
                    to counteract the dot damage and use
                    <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-overload">Overload</span>
                    to root the merc and prevent it from following, or you can simply
                    stun the merc with
                    <span class="sprite sprite-electrocute">Electrocute</span>
                    or a Seismic Grenade to negate its damage. This is generally a
                    horrific trade of defensives on the merc&apos;s part, so ensure
                    that you punish this behavior by either stunlocking and killing
                    the merc immediately now that it has no defensives that are usable
                    while stunned (if you have your stun available), or typing to your
                    team and moving the merc up next in the kill order so your team
                    can stunlock it for you.</p>
                <h3>Playing With Supports</h3>
                <p>Finally, having support roles on your team will change the way in
                    which you kite. Since the supports need to be able to guard or
                    heal you, you will need to stay within their effective range in
                    order for this to work, which quite a small arena to play in.
                    Therefore, we will need to make some adjustments to our kiting
                    style.</p>
                <h4>Kiting With Tanks</h4>
                <p>With a tank on your team, you should play as if the enemy team is
                    entirely ranged (regardless of what it actually is). Guard does
                    not require line of sight to function, and thus you should make
                    yourself impossible to catch by playing ring-around-the-rosy with
                    an object an applying slows to the players chasing you in order
                    to slow down the incoming damage.</p>
                <h4>Kiting With Healers (or Both)</h4>
                <p>Healing, on the other hand, does require line of sight on the
                    target, so when you have a healer you should (almost always) play
                    entirely in the open field. In order to mitigate melee damage you
                    will still be running away, but this time do so in a circle so
                    that you never actually end up too far from your healer to be
                    healed (or break his casts with line of sight objects). The
                    diameter of said circle should be about 20 meters.</p>
                <p>There are two exceptions to this rules, those being:
                    <ol>
                        <li>If the enemy team is entirely ranged, play is if you had
                            a tank instead of a healer. You will mitigate more damage
                            in this way than you will healing, although a bad healer
                            will rage at you and probably cause a loss in this case.
                            Which brings us to&hellip;</li>
                        <li>If your healer is shit, play as if you do not have one
                            (that is, if there&apos;s a tank, play it like tank games,
                            and if there isn&apos;t a tank, play it like all-DPS games.)</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Playing Around DCDs</h3>
                <p>I&apos;ve touched on this briefly before, but it is important, so
                    let&apos;s cover it again. As an arena player of any kind, it&apos;s
                    advantageous to only expose yourself to damage when you can do
                    something productive. That is to say, hide behind a wall or an
                    object when a player pops major defensive cooldowns. There are two
                    ways to play this, depending if you are taking damage or not. If
                    you are taking damage, which you most likely will when you are new,
                    it&apos;s helpful to time your escapes (your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-phase-walk">Phase Walk</span> and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-force-barrier">Force Barrier</span>)
                    with major enemy DCDs, like a merc or PT&apos;s Kolto Overload, or
                    a marauder&apos;s Undying Rage. This way, your target can&apos;t
                    get free damage on you without taking any themselves. It also
                    makes it so that if they spend time chasing you, they essentially
                    kite out their own DCD, which is also advantageous for your team.</p>
                <p>The second situation to consider is when your target pops a major
                    defensive cooldown, and you are not the target (this is called
                    freecasting). In this instance, you should just swap to the
                    second target until the first target&apos;s DCD expires in order
                    to avoid wasting damage. Keeping your
                    <span class="sprite sprite-creeping-terror">Creeping Terror</span>
                    and
                    <span class="sprite sprite-affliction">Affliction</span>
                    on multiple targets is actually a net benefit to your damage as
                    madness, so don&apos;t hesitate to apply these to all your swap
                    targets.
