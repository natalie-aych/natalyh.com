            </div>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Natalyh (obviously this is not my real name, it&apos;s the name of one of my toons that people started to know me by.) I started playing SWTOR in 2018 as a story noob and then at some point later got into PvP and ranked just in time to experience the end of Season 10 (and somehow stumble my way into a bronze).</p>
            <p>I started playing on Satele Shan during seasons 10, 11, and 12, then during preseason 13 made the transition to Star Forge, where I got my first gold later that season. Like most people who still play at this point, I&apos;ve left and come back to this game a number of times and I like to maintain a presence on all servers, though being a west coast player with shitty wifi makes it very difficult to play on European servers most of the time. I do like to travel though, so you may see me over there if I happen to be on the right side of the world at the time.</p>

                <h3>What do you play?</h3>
                <p>I am primarily a sorcerer main (and sage, it&apos;s literally the same class), mostly because 90% of the reason I enjoy this game is shooting lightning at people. As any ranked player should I have played all classes at a reasonable level in regs, though I would hardly qualify that as experience. In an attempt to diversify my skillset I have also played Mercernary and Sniper in ranked a fair (silver) bit. I find melee classes don&apos;t really fit my playstyle well, but I do dabble with Lethality Operative and Hatred Assassin because I enjoy dot spreading.</p>

                <h3>Are you a girl?</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, no. This is the name of one of my story toons that happened to be female and people started to identify me by, so here we are. I&apos;ll still take your free shit if you want to give it to me, though.</p>
